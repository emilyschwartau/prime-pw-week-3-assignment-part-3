    <ol type="1">
      <li> I'm having a hard time understanding when "if" statements vs "else if" statements are needed. If the "if" statement was false, wouldn't it execute the next "if" statement? What's the point of "else if"?</li>
      <li> How do you know what type of loop to use when? Is it personal choice? Or are the different types conventionally used for specific reasons?</li>
      <li> Are variables always defined outside of the while loop? Could they somehow be defined inside, like they are in a for loop? </li>
    </ol>
